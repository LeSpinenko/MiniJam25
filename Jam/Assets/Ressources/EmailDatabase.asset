  - title: 'Archmage Vihaa Gra, Alchemist of Unmatched Potency '
    body: "Subject: Arcane Enhancement for Your... Reach Esteemed Wielder of Might,
      Through my years of tireless alchemical research, I have uncovered an elixir
      capable of greatly extending one\u2019s reach\u2014both in battle and in life.
      Many a warrior and marksman have sworn by its effects, claiming that their
      strikes now extend far beyond their former limits. For a limited time, I offer
      you a flask of this miraculous draught. Simply ingest the potion before battle,
      and you shall find your range increased by 2 full spans. No side effects have
      been reported\u2026 aside from an overwhelming sense of confidence. Shall you
      seize this opportunity to enhance your prowess? Or shall you remain as you
      are, perhaps... falling short when it matters most? Archmage Vihaa Gra  Purveyor
      of Potency, Master of Mystical Extensions "

    body: "Subject: Urgent Decree \u2013 Secure Thy Fortress! Most Esteemed Lord,
      A most dire missive reaches thee this day! The shadowy agents of the Kingdom
      of Spammers have taken great interest in thy lands. By decree of His Most Honorable
      Majesty, Duke von Privassy, it is imperative that thou secureth thy fortifications
      posthaste. For a meager sum of only 15 gold coins, our most skilled scribes
      shall shroud thy castle\u2019s location in secrecy, weaving enchantments and
      forging documents most cunning. Without such protection, thy enemies shall
      surely descend upon thee like vultures to a fresh carcass. Dost thou accept
      this prudent measure, or shall thou risk the wrath of unseen foes? The choice
      is thine, but beware\u2014those who do not hide shall soon be found. May wisdom
      guide thy quill,  Von Privassy, Royal Scribe of the Northern Kingdom "

  - title: Prad Bitt, Renowned Troubadour of the Western Realm
    body: 'Subject: A Proposal of Love and Shared Fortune Dearest Noble Lord/Lady,
      I am Prad Bitt, the most celebrated troubadour of the Western Realm. Tales
      of your grace and beauty have reached my ears, and I find myself enamored without
      even having met you. My heart yearns to share with you the treasures I have
      gathered during my travels. However, I am currently detained in a distant land,
      ensnared by the schemes of the envious. To prove my love and devotion, I wish
      to send you a chest filled with 830 gold coins. Yet, to facilitate this, I
      require a modest sum of 83 gold coins to cover the costs of transport and customs.
      By accepting this humble request, you open the door to an epic romance and
      unparalleled prosperity. Together, we shall compose ballads of love and reign
      over the hearts of all. Awaiting your passionate reply, Prad Bitt  Renowned
      Troubadour of the Western Realm '

  - title: 'The Brotherhood of the Gallant Steed '
    body: 'Subject: A Noble Cause for Our Retired Riders Honorable Lord/Lady, For
      generations, the fearless knights and couriers of the realm have ridden tirelessly
      into battle and beyond, delivering missives, waging war, and ensuring that
      the lands remain connected. Yet, as the years pass, even the finest steeds
      grow weary, and the bravest riders must lay down their reins. Thus, The Brotherhood
      of the Gallant Steed humbly seeks your support in aiding these valiant souls
      in their well-earned retirement. A modest contribution of 5 gold coins shall
      provide them with warm lodgings, hearty meals, and well-deserved care for their
      loyal mounts. Will you honor the riders who once served your cause, or shall
      they be left to wander the roads, seeking alms in their twilight years? With
      gratitude and steadfast duty,  Sir Garran Hoofmere  Grand Steward of the Brotherhood
      of the Gallant Steed'
